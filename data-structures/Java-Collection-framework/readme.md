# Java Collection framework
- The Java Collections Framework is a set of classes and interfaces in Java that provide various types of data structures and algorithms to store, manipulate, and process collections of objects. It is a fundamental part of the Java programming language and is widely used in Java applications.  
- Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.
- A Collection represents a single unit of objects, i.e., a group.
- Frame work is nothing but it provides readymade architecture.
## Interfaces
- **Collection:** The root interface of the collection hierarchy. It defines the basic methods that all collections will have, such as add, remove, contains, etc.
- **List:** An ordered collection that allows duplicate elements. Some commonly used classes that implement List are ArrayList and LinkedList.
- **Set:** An unordered collection that does not allow duplicate elements. Common implementations include HashSet and TreeSet.
- **Queue:** A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing. Common implementations are LinkedList and PriorityQueue.
- **Map:** An object that maps keys to values. Implementations include HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap.
## Classes
- **[ArrayList:](Java-Collection-framework/ArrayList)** Implements the List interface using a dynamic array. It is resizable and allows fast random access to elements.
- **LinkedList:** Implements the List interface using a doubly-linked list. It provides efficient insertion and deletion operations.
- **HashSet:** Implements the Set interface using a hash table. It does not allow duplicate elements.
- **TreeSet:** Implements the Set interface using a red-black tree. It provides elements in sorted order.
- **HashMap:** Implements the Map interface using a hash table for key-value pairs. It allows null keys and values.
- **TreeMap:** Implements the Map interface using a red-black tree. It provides key-value pairs in sorted order.
